==========

Experiments and learning about how colors and shit work.

Could be used as a general color library too.

Inspired by Argyll (http://argyllcms.com/) after getting a colorimeter and finding such great calibration software (and wanting to find out what the numbers mean).

Uses:https://github.com/cureos/csbobyqa as a non-linear solver to calculate color temperature
